		[h1] Remove Traits [/h1]
		A simple mod that can remove colonists' traits.

		[h1] More details [/h1]
		You can randomly remove one trait from colonist per surgery.
		Since the surgery is kinda old and brutal, the surgeon requires both melee and medicine.
		Require 3 medicines and 1 wood.
		This mod is created for my medieval collection and some modding practices.
		Still wondering why trait can be added from dev mode but can't remove it.

		[h1] Language Support [/h1]
		English
